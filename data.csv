1,"O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend"
1,"The brightest heaven of invention,"
1,"A kingdom for a stage, princes to act"
1,And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
1,"Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,"
1,"Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,"
1,"Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire"
1,"Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,"
1,The flat unraised spirits that have dared
1,On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
1,So great an object: can this cockpit hold
1,The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
1,Within this wooden O the very casques
1,That did affright the air at Agincourt?
1,"O, pardon! since a crooked figure may"
1,Attest in little place a million;
1,"And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,"
1,On your imaginary forces work.
1,Suppose within the girdle of these walls
1,"Are now confined two mighty monarchies,"
1,Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
1,The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
1,Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;
1,"Into a thousand parts divide on man,"
1,And make imaginary puissance;
1,"Think when we talk of horses, that you see them"
1,Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;
1,"For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,"
1,"Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,"
1,Turning the accomplishment of many years
1,"Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,"
1,Admit meto this history;
1,"Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,"
1,"Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play."
1,SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.
1," the ARCHBISHOP OF , and the BISHOP OF"
1,"My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,"
1,Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
1,"Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,"
1,But that the scambling and unquiet time
1,Did push it out of farther question.
1,"But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?"
1,"It must be thought on. If it pass against us,"
1,We lose the better half of our possession:
1,For all the temporal lands which men devout
1,By testament have given to the church
1,Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
1,"As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,"
1,"Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,"
1,Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
1,"And, to relief of lazars and weak age,"
1,Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.
1,A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
1,"And to the coffers of the king beside,"
1,A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.
1,This would drink deep.
1,'Twould drink the cup and all.
1,But what prevention?
1,The king is full of grace and fair regard.
1,And a true lover of the holy church.
1,The courses of his youth promised it not.
1,"The breath no sooner left his father's body,"
1,"But that his wildness, mortified in him,"
1,"Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment"
1,"Consideration, like an angel, came"
1,"And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,"
1,"Leaving his body as a paradise,"
1,To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
1,Never was such a sudden scholar made;
1,"Never came reformation in a flood,"
1,"With such a heady currance, scouring faults"
1,Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
1,So soon did lose his seat and all at once
1,As in this king.
1,We are blessed in the change.
1,"Hear him but reason in divinity,"
1,And all-admiring with an inward wish
1,You would desire the king were made a prelate:
1,"Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,"
1,You would say it hath been all in all his study:
1,"List his discourse of war, and you shall hear"
1,A fearful battle render'd you in music:
1,"Turn him to any cause of policy,"
1,"The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,"
1,"Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,"
1,"The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,"
1,"And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,"
1,To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
1,So that the art and practic part of life
1,Must be the mistress to this theoric:
1,"Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,"
1,"Since his addiction was to courses vain,"
1,"His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,"
1,"His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,"
1,"And never noted in him any study,"
1,"Any retirement, any sequestration"
1,From open haunts and popularity.
1,The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
1,And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
1,Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
1,And so the prince obscured his contemplation
1,"Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,"
1,"Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,"
1,"Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty."
1,It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
1,And therefore we must needs admit the means
1,How things are perfected.
1,"But, my good lord,"
1,How now for mitigation of this bill
1,Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
1,"Incline to it, or no?"
1,"He seems indifferent,"
1,Or rather swaying more upon our part
1,Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
1,"For I have made an offer to his majesty,"
1,Upon our spiritual convocation
1,"And in regard of causes now in hand,"
1,"Which I have open'd to his grace at large,"
1,"As touching France, to give a greater sum"
1,Than ever at one time the clergy yet
1,Did to his predecessors part withal.
1,"How did this offer seem received, my lord?"
1,With good acceptance of his majesty;
1,"Save that there was not time enough to hear,"
1,"As I perceived his grace would fain have done,"
1,The severals and unhidden passages
1,Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
1,And generally to the crown and seat of France
1,"Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather."
1,What was the impediment that broke this off?
1,The French ambassador upon that instant
1,"Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come"
1,To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?
1,It is.
1,"Then go we in, to know his embassy;"
1,"Which I could with a ready guess declare,"
1,Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
1,"I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it."
1,SCENE II. The same. The Presence chamber.
1,and Attendants 
1,Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
1,Not here in presence.
1,"Send for him, good uncle."
1,"Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?"
1,"Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,"
1,"Before we hear him, of some things of weight"
1,"That task our thoughts, concerning us and France."
1," the ARCHBISHOP OF , and the BISHOP of "
1,God and his angels guard your sacred throne
1,And make you long become it!
1,"Sure, we thank you."
1,"My learned lord, we pray you to proceed"
1,And justly and religiously unfold
1,Why the law Salique that they have in France
1,"Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:"
1,"And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,"
1,"That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,"
1,Or nicely charge your understanding soul
1,"With opening titles miscreate, whose right"
1,Suits not in native colours with the truth;
1,For God doth know how many now in health
1,Shall drop their blood in approbation
1,Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
1,"Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,"
1,How you awake our sleeping sword of war:
1,"We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;"
1,For never two such kingdoms did contend
1,Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
1,"Are every one a woe, a sore complaint"
1,'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
1,That make such waste in brief mortality.
1,"Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;"
1,"For we will hear, note and believe in heart"
1,That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
1,As pure as sin with baptism.
1,"Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,"
1,"That owe yourselves, your lives and services"
1,To this imperial throne. There is no bar
1,To make against your highness' claim to France
1,"But this, which they produce from Pharamond,"
1,'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
1,'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
1,Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
1,"To be the realm of France, and Pharamond"
1,The founder of this law and female bar.
1,Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
1,"That the land Salique is in Germany,"
1,Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
1,"Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,"
1,There left behind and settled certain French;
1,"Who, holding in disdain the German women"
1,"For some dishonest manners of their life,"
1,"Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female"
1,Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
1,"Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,"
1,Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
1,Then doth it well appear that Salique law
1,Was not devised for the realm of France:
1,Nor did the French possess the Salique land
1,Until four hundred one and twenty years
1,"After defunction of King Pharamond,"
1,Idly supposed the founder of this law;
1,Who died within the year of our redemption
1,Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
1,"Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French"
1,"Beyond the river Sala, in the year"
1,"Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,"
1,"King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,"
1,"Did, as heir general, being descended"
1,"Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,"
1,Make claim and title to the crown of France.
1,"Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown"
1,"Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male"
1,"Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,"
1,"To find his title with some shows of truth,"
1,"'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,"
1,"Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,"
1,"Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son"
1,"To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son"
1,"Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,"
1,"Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,"
1,"Could not keep quiet in his conscience,"
1,"Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied"
1,"That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,"
1,"Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,"
1,Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:
1,By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
1,Was re-united to the crown of France.
1,"So that, as clear as is the summer's sun."
1,"King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,"
1,"King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear"
1,To hold in right and title of the female:
1,So do the kings of France unto this day;
1,Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
1,"To bar your highness claiming from the female,"
1,And rather choose to hide them in a net
1,Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
1,Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.
1,May I with right and conscience make this claim?
1,"The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!"
1,"For in the book of Numbers is it writ,"
1,"When the man dies, let the inheritance"
1,"Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,"
1,Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
1,Look back into your mighty ancestors:
1,"Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,"
1,"From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,"
1,"And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,"
1,"Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,"
1,"Making defeat on the full power of France,"
1,Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
1,Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
1,Forage in blood of French nobility.
1,O noble English. that could tain
1,With half their forces the full Pride of France
1,"And let another half stand laughing by,"
1,All out of work and cold for action!
1,Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
1,And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
1,You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
1,The blood and courage that renowned them
1,Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
1,"Is in the very May-morn of his youth,"
1,Ripe for exploits and mighty prises.
1,Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
1,"Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,"
1,As did the former lions of your blood.
1,They know your grace hath cause and means and might;
1,So hath your highness; never king of England
1,"Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,"
1,Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
1,And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
1,"O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,"
1,With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
1,In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
1,Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
1,As never did the clergy at one time
1,Bring in to any of your ancestors.
1,"We must not only arm to invade the French,"
1,But lay down our proportions to defend
1,"Against the Scot, who will make road upon us"
1,With all advantages.
1,"They of those marches, gracious sovereign,"
1,Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
1,Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
1,"We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,"
1,"But fear the main intendment of the Scot,"
1,Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;
1,For you shall read that my great-grandfather
1,Never went with his forces into France
1,But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
1,"Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,"
1,"With ample and brim fulness of his force,"
1,"Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,"
1,Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
1,"That England, being empty of defence,"
1,Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.
1,"She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;"
1,For hear her but exampled by herself:
1,When all her chivalry hath been in France
1,"And she a mourning widow of her nobles,"
1,She hath herself not only well defended
1,But taken and impounded as a stray
1,"The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,"
1,To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
1,And make her chronicle as rich with praise
1,As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
1,With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.
1,"But there's a saying very old and true,"
1,"'If that you will France win,"
1,Then with Scotland first begin:'
1,"For once the eagle England being in prey,"
1,To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
1,"Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,"
1,"Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,"
1,To tear and havoc more than she can eat.
1,It follows then the cat must stay at home:
1,"Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,"
1,"Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,"
1,And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
1,"While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,"
1,The advised head defends itself at home;
1,"For government, though high and low and lower,"
1,"Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,"
1,"Congreeing in a full and natural close,"
1,Like music.
1,Therefore doth heaven divide
1,"The state of man in divers functions,"
1,Setting endeavour in continual motion;
1,"To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,"
1,"Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,"
1,Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
1,The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
1,They have a king and officers of sorts;
1,"Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,"
1,"Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,"
1,"Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,"
1,"Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,"
1,Which pillage they with merry march bring home
1,To the tent-royal of their emperor;
1,"Who, busied in his majesty, surveys"
1,"The singing masons building roofs of gold,"
1,"The civil citizens kneading up the honey,"
1,The poor mechanic porters crowding in
1,"Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,"
1,"The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,"
1,Delivering o'er to executors pale
1,"The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,"
1,"That many things, having full reference"
1,"To one consent, may work contrariously:"
1,"As many arrows, loosed several ways,"
1,Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
1,As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
1,As many lines close in the dial's centre;
1,"So may a thousand actions, once afoot."
1,"End in one purpose, and be all well borne"
1,"Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege."
1,Divide your happy England into four;
1,"Whereof take you one quarter into France,"
1,And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
1,"If we, with thrice such powers left at home,"
1,"Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,"
1,Let us be worried and our nation lose
1,The name of hardiness and policy.
1,Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
1, some Attendants
1,"Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,"
1,"And yours, the noble sinews of our power,"
1,"France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,"
1,"Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,"
1,Ruling in large and ample empery
1,"O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,"
1,"Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,"
1,"Tombless, with no remembrance over them:"
1,Either our history shall with full mouth
1,"Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,"
1,"Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,"
1,Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.
1, Ambassadors of France
1,Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
1,Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
1,"Your greeting is from him, not from the king."
1,First Ambassador 
1,May't please your majesty to give us leave
1,Freely to render what we have in charge;
1,Or shall we sparingly show you far off
1,The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
1,"We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;"
1,Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
1,As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:
1,Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
1,Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
1,First Ambassador 
1,"Thus, then, in few."
1,"Your highness, lately sending into France,"
1,"Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right"
1,"Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third."
1,"In answer of which claim, the prince our master"
1,"Says that you savour too much of your youth,"
1,And bids you be advised there's nought in France
1,That can be with a nimble galliard won;
1,You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
1,"He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,"
1,"This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,"
1,Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
1,Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
1,"What treasure, uncle?"
1,"Tennis-balls, my liege."
1,We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
1,His present and your pains we thank you for:
1,"When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,"
1,"We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set"
1,Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
1,Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
1,That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
1,"With chaces. And we understand him well,"
1,"How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,"
1,Not measuring what use we made of them.
1,We never valued this poor seat of England;
1,"And therefore, living hence, did give ourself"
1,To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common
1,That men are merriest when they are from home.
1,"But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,"
1,Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
1,When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
1,For that I have laid by my majesty
1,"And plodded like a man for working-days,"
1,But I will rise there with so full a glory
1,"That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,"
1,"Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us."
1,And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
1,Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
1,Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
1,That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
1,Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
1,"Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;"
1,And some are yet ungotten and unborn
1,That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
1,"But this lies all within the will of God,"
1,To whom I do appeal; and in whose name
1,"Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,"
1,To venge me as I may and to put forth
1,My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
1,So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
1,"His jest will savour but of shallow wit,"
1,When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
1,Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
1, Ambassadors
1,This was a merry message.
1,We hope to make the sender blush at it.
1,"Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour"
1,That may give furtherance to our expedition;
1,"For we have now no thought in us but France,"
1,"Save those to God, that run before our business."
1,Therefore let our proportions for these wars
1,Be soon collected and all things thought upon
1,That may with reasonable swiftness add
1,"More feathers to our wings; for, God before,"
1,We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
1,"Therefore let every man now task his thought,"
1,That this fair action may on foot be brought.
1,. Flourish
1,"Now all the youth of England are on fire,"
1,And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:
1,"Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought"
1,Reigns solely in the breast of every man:
1,"They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,"
1,"Following the mirror of all Christian kings,"
1,"With winged heels, as English Mercuries."
1,"For now sits Expectation in the air,"
1,And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
1,"With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,"
1,Promised to Harry and his followers.
1,"The French, advised by good intelligence"
1,"Of this most dreadful preparation,"
1,Shake in their fear and with pale policy
1,Seek to divert the English purposes.
1,"O England! model to thy inward greatness,"
1,"Like little body with a mighty heart,"
1,"What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,"
1,Were all thy children kind and natural!
1,But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
1,"A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills"
1,"With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,"
1,"One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,"
1,"Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,"
1,"Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,"
1,"Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!"
1,Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;
1,"And by their hands this grace of kings must die,"
1,"If hell and treason hold their promises,"
1,"Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton."
1,Linger your patience on; and we'll digest
1,The abuse of distance; force a play:
1,The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;
1,The king is set from London; and the scene
1,"Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;"
1,"There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:"
1,"And thence to France shall we convey you safe,"
1,"And bring you back, charming the narrow seas"
1,"To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,"
1,We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
1,"But, till the king come forth, and not till then,"
1,Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.
1,SCENE I. London. A street.
1, Corporaland Lieutenant
1,"Well met, Corporal Nym."
1,"Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph."
1,"What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?"
1,"For my part, I care not: I say little; but when"
1,"time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that"
1,shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will
1,wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but
1,"what though? it will toast cheese, and it will"
1,endure cold as another man's sword will: and
1,there's an end.
1,I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and
1,we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it
1,"be so, good Corporal Nym."
1,"Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the"
1,"certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I"
1,"will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the"
1,rendezvous of it.
1,"It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell"
1,Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you
1,were troth-plight to her.
1,I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may
1,"sleep, and they may have their throats about them at"
1,that time; and some say knives have edges. It must
1,"be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet"
1,"she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I"
1,cannot tell.
1,and 
1,Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good
1,"corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!"
1,"Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,"
1,"I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers."
1,"No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and"

1,"And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,"
1,"And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!"
1,I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;
1,"For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,"
1,And flashing fire will follow.
1,I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an

1,"Away, you rogue!"
1,"By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of"
1,these days. The king has killed his heart. Good

1,the even of it.

1,His heart is fracted and corroborate.
1,The king is a good king: but it must be as it may;
1,he passes some humours and careers.

1,They shall be apprehended by and by.
1,How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
1,"As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,"
1,Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.
1,"The king hath note of all that they intend,"
1,By interception which they dream not of.
1,"Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,"
1,"Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,"
1,"That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell"
1,His sovereign's life to death and treachery.
1,Trumpets sound.and Attendants
1,"Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard."
1,"My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,"
1,"And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:"
1,Think you not that the powers we bear with us
1,"Will cut their passage through the force of France,"
1,Doing the execution and the act
1,For which we have in head assembled them?
1,"No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best."
1,I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded
1,We carry not a heart with us from hence
1,"That grows not in a fair consent with ours,"
1,Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
1,Success and conquest to attend on us.
1,Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
1,"Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject"
1,That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
1,Under the sweet shade of your government.
1,True: those that were your father's enemies
1,Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
1,With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
1,We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;
1,"And shall forget the office of our hand,"
1,Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
1,According to the weight and worthiness.
1,"So service shall with steeled sinews toil,"
1,"And labour shall refresh itself with hope,"
1,To do your grace incessant services.
1,"We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,"
1,"Enlarge the man committed yesterday,"
1,That rail'd against our person: we consider
1,it was excess of wine that set him on;
1,And on his more advice we pardon him.
1,"That's mercy, but too much security:"
1,"Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example"
1,"Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind."
1,"O, let us yet be merciful."
1,"So may your highness, and yet punish too."
1,"Sir,"
1,"You show great mercy, if you give him life,"
1,After the taste of much correction.
1,"Alas, your too much love and care of me"
1,Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!
1,"If little faults, proceeding on distemper,"
1,"Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye"
1,"When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,"
1,"Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,"
1,"Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care"
1,"And tender preservation of our person,"
1,Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:
1,Who are the late commissioners?
1,"I one, my lord:"
1,Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.
1,"So did you me, my liege."
1,"And I, my royal sovereign."
1,"Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;"
1,"There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,"
1,"Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:"
1,"Read them; and know, I know your worthiness."
1,"My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,"
1,"We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!"
1,What see you in those papers that you lose
1,"So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!"
1,"Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there"
1,That hath so cowarded and chased your blood
1,Out of appearance?
1,I do confess my fault;
1,And do submit me to your highness' mercy.
1,To which we all appeal.
1,"The mercy that was quick in us but late,"
1,By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:
1,"You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;"
1,"For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,"
1,"As dogs upon their masters, worrying you."
1,"See you, my princes, and my noble peers,"
1,"These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,"
1,You know how apt our love was to accord
1,To furnish him with all appertinents
1,Belonging to his honour; and this man
1,"Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,"
1,"And sworn unto the practises of France,"
1,To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
1,"This knight, no less for bounty bound to us"
1,"Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,"
1,"What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,"
1,"Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!"
1,"Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,"
1,"That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,"
1,"That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,"
1,"Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,"
1,"May it be possible, that foreign hire"
1,Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
1,"That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,"
1,"That, though the truth of it stands off as gross"
1,"As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it."
1,"Treason and murder ever kept together,"
1,"As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,"
1,"Working so grossly in a natural cause,"
